# Mod_Buffer for Zotonic
===========================
Automagically share articles, pictures, videos, RSS Feed links through the day!
Inspired by http://bufferapp.com, and currently supports only Twitter.

## How it works
This module uses the mod_cron module for Zotonic, and the erlang-oauth library.
It comes with a simple UI for adding, editing, deleting, and sharing buffers.
